/*
In the case LLRR : 
<- <- -> ->
 L  L  R  R 
 
there will be no collisions since two cars are moving towards Left and two cars moving towards right


In the case RRRRLLL : 
->  ->  -> ->   <- <- <- 
R    R   R  R   L  L  L
0    1   2  3   4  5  6

 Cars 3 and 4 collide and become stationary (S), since cars 0, 1, 2 are moving towards this stationary car so they will all 
 collide and car 5 and 6 are moving towards the same stationary card from the left direction so even they will collide and 
 become stationary (S). We will store cars 0,1,2,3 in stack and when current car is driving towards left we pop 3 and change 
 the current carâ€™s state to stationary and pop rest previous cars driving towards it from the right direction and calculate the 
 collision value. 


In the case RSLRL: 

-> |  <-  -> <-
R  S  L    R  L 
0  1  2    3  4

Car 0 collides with the stationary car 1, car 2 collides with the stationary car 1 and cars 3 and 4 collide with each other.
